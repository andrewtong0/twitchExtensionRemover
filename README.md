# twitchExtensionRemover
A simple and lightweight Chrome extension that disables and removes intrusive desktop Twitch extensions. The removal of these extensions re-enables the ability to double-click to fullscreen.

I made this extension quite literally for the above reason. I was annoyed by the extensions that Twitch has added that disables the ability to double-click and fullscreen streams, as well as a lot of extensions are useless or blatant advertising.

### Installation Instructions
- In your browser URL bar, go to "chrome://extensions"
- In the top right corner of the extensions screen, enable "Developer mode"
- In the menu bar that appears, click "Load unpacked"
- Navigate to the downloaded extension (must be unzipped to a full folder)
- Enable the extension and you should be good to go!

### Notes
- Only works on Google Chrome
